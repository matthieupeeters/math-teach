Notational improvements to math to make it easier to teach.


Notation for root/log/power:
  3
2 V    = 2 ^ 3

  3
  V 8  = 8 ^ (1/3) = cubrt(8)


2 V 8  = log(8) / log(2) = log2(8)


The V can be extended by two outward horizontal lines at the top. In a way that they are above the base and the power. Think of an ordinary √ sign. Of course the exponent can be inside the V shape, as with a ∜ symbol. 
Note the symetry in this notation. 


A complementary notation might make negative numbers easier to gasp, or at least to calculate. To indicate complementary numbers a prefix can be used. For negative numbers the prefix used here is: ९ (U+096F, this is the number 9 in Devanagari, and can also be seen as "below zero"). Another possibility is ߉ (U+07C9) but since it is written right-to-left it makes typing numbers harder. 

This symbol of course is not used in the same way as a - sign. 

   0  = 0 or 00 or 000 etc (all positive numbers can have any number of prefixing zeros, as in normal notation)
   1  = 1 or 01 or 001 etc
  -1  = ९ or ९9 or ९99 or ९९9 etc (not that, at least for now, repeating the sign doesn't change its meaning)
  -2  = ९8 or ९98 or ९998 or ९९8 etc. (possibly a normalized notation is useful)
  -3  = ९7 etc. (ex. ९7 + 03 = 00)
  -4  = ९6 etc. (ex. ९6 + 05 = 01)
  -5  = ९5 (ex. ९5 + 02 = ९7)
  -6  = ९4 (ex. ९4 + ९8 = ९2, note the carry-over into ९ dissapears)
  -7  = ९3 (ex. ९3 + ९3 = ९86, note that the lack of a carry-over into ९ makes it a ९8)
  -8  = ९2 (ex. ९2 - 01 = ९1 = ९2 + ९9)
  -9  = ९1 (ex. ९1 - ९8 = ९3, note that the borrow from ९ dissapears.)
 -10  = ९0 (ex. ९90 + 10 = 0)
 -11  = ९89
 -12  = ९88
 -13  = ९87
 -20  = ९80
 -21  = ९79
 -25  = ९75
 -50  = ९50
 -86  = ९14
 -98  = ९02
 -99  = ९01
-100  = ९00 = ९900
-101  =९899

Duodecimal notation, or at least introductions to the concept, might improve learning fractions. A prefix might be used to distinguish with decimal notation.
